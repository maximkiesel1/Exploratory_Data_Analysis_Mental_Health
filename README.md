## Project Motivation

This analysis is should improve the awareness about the importantness of mental health.

The goal is to get an insight in the suicide rates of the top 30 industry nations.

This helps us to understand in which direction the suicide rates were developing and 

what are areas which we need to act.



In this analysis I will look at 3 key aspects of the top 30 countries by GDP:

- Which 5 countries have the highest suicide rate over the years and how does it differ from the most recent data point?
- Which age group has highest suicide rate over the years and how does it differ from the most recent data point?
- Which generation have the highest suicide rate?

## File Descriptions

There are 3 files in this repository:
- ReadMe: General project overview
- data.csv: the dataset for the analysis
- Global_Suicide_Analysis1.ipynb: the juypter notebook for this analysis


## The Analysis
For the analysis the main libraries were numpy, pandas. Viusalizations has a big part in this analyzation, 
because it´s based on principles of Descriptive Statistics. That´s why I used next to matplot plotly and pyecharts too.
